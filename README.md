tutorial to add to website/ play on flash emulator.
To play on browser (if your making a website only) you want to put this embed code in
<script src="https://happygamer1450.github.io/Ruffle-Embedded/ruffle/ruffle.js"></script>
<div class="swf"dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
        <embed height="480" pluginspage=" http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" src="https:/testingherokuapp.github.io/the-binding-of-isaac-flash/3801.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="620"></embed>
</div>

This should work unless if your making a website at school mine are blocked. all you got to do is remove my link and put in yours once the page is done uploading

Flash emulator (.exe)
Download the swf and open it in emulator and enjoy playing
